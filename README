Original Intent:
================

I had to setup and maintain 10 Macbook Air for the City University (of Hong Kong) Laptop Orchestra. I maintain a working disk image for the the 10 laptops. After imaging there are always scores, drivers or applications that need to be installed before a performance. This script, based at the root of a USB thumbdrive, will copy performance files, install necessary supporting software and then eject the thumbdrive when done.

What it does:
=============

- Install Leap Motion pkg file
- Backup laptop's performance files folder
- Copy the new performance files using rsync -- trying to save time on big files
- Find the volume name from which the script is running and eject it
